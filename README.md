Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It uses the TF-IDF vectorizer to convert news text into numerical features and a Passive Aggressive Classifier for model training. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's accuracy and generate a confusion matrix. This setup helps in classifying news as either FAKE or REAL based on the content.

âœ… Libraries used: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
ðŸŽ¯ Model Accuracy: Printed after evaluation
ðŸ“Š Output: Classification accuracy + Confusion matrix
